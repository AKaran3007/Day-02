About HTTP methods
HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
The primary or most commonly-used HTTP methods are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These methods correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other methods, too, but they are utilized less frequently.
HTTP has four versions â€” HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2.0. 
Today the version in common use is HTTP/1.1 and the future will be HTTP/2.0.
HTTP/0.9 - The Original HTTP as defined in 1991. This document defines the Hypertext Transfer protocol (HTTP) as originally implemented by the World Wide Web initaitive software in the prototype released. This is a subset of the full HTTP protocol, and is known as HTTP 0.9
HTTP/1.0 - It is a generic, stateless protocol that can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes, and headers. HTTP 1.0 was officially introduced and recognized in 1996.
HTTP/1.1 - HTTP 1.1 is the latest version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the World Wide Web application protocol that runs on top of the Internet's TCP/IP suite of protocols. HTTP 1.1 provides faster delivery of Web pages than the original HTTP and reduces Web traffic.
HTTP/2.0 - HTTP/2.0 is under testing condition it is available in beta version only comparatively to HTTP 1.1 the HTTP 2.0 will be most faster and efficient it will be less than 1 sec
